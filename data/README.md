# Covid tracker

Two files were generated by Jean Czerlinski Whitmore based on
data from ttps://covidtracking.com/race (which no longer updates)
and sent to me by email:

- `kaggle_imputed_and_lagged.csv` (2021-03-17) (Sundays)
- `kaggle_imputed_and_lagged_weds.csv` (2021-03-20) (Wednesdays)

Jean's preprocessing with explanations is at https://www.kaggle.com/code/jeanimal/covid-by-race-data-processing/notebook


# CDC

The file `covid-cdc-states.csv` contains a list of the 38 states used in the
analysis (i.e., excluding those with either no reported deaths or the same
number of deaths as cases).
